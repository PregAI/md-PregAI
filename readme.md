## Features:

- Real-time pose detection using camera access on smartphones.
- Machine learning model to assess users' yoga poses.
- Guidance on safe yoga poses for pregnant women.
- Progression to the next pose only when the current pose is done correctly and held for a specified time.

## Libraries:

### Android Jetpack:
- Lifecycle & Livedata
- Kotlin Flow
- Navigation Component
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Retrofit
- Hilt as Dependency Injection
- OkHttp 3

### Android Library:
- JUnit (for unit testing framework)
- Mockito (for testing, creating, and using mock objects)
- Retrofit (HTTP client for making network requests REST API)
- Glide (for efficient loading and caching of images)
- Dagger/RxJava (for reactive programming)
- TensorFlow Lite (machine learning library for on-device model inference on Android)
- Android KTX (for improved code readability and conciseness in Android development)

### Jetpack:
- CameraX (Android Jetpack library simplifying camera development with backward compatibility)
- Room (for easier data storage in Android apps)
- ViewModel/LiveData (for managing UI-related data and lifecycle awareness)
- Compose (for building UIs using a declarative syntax in Kotlin)
- Paging (for efficiently loading large data sets in a paginated manner)

## Executive Summary/Abstract:

Maternal mortality is a significant global health concern, especially in developing countries. The PregAI: Yoga app addresses this issue by providing pregnant women with a personal yoga instructor equipped with real-time feedback based on machine learning pose estimation tailored to the user's pregnancy trimester. This application aims to provide comfort and safety during prenatal yoga practice.

## How did your team come up with this project?

Prenatal yoga, tailored for expectant mothers, serves the dual purpose of maintaining health during pregnancy and preparing for a safe delivery. To overcome challenges in accessing suitable yoga classes, the team developed a dedicated Kotlin-based application exclusively for pregnant women. This app offers guidance and recognizes yoga movements demonstrated by a yoga instructor.

## Project Scope & Deliverables:

### Project Scope:

- Detect users' poses using smartphone cameras.
- Build a machine learning model to assess users' yoga poses.
- Provide guidance on safe yoga poses for pregnant women.
- Limit detection to simple yoga poses due to time constraints and model size and complexity.

### Deliverables:

- Users can use the application to practice yoga poses correctly and safely.
- Camera-based pose tracking ensures accurate yoga practice.
- Progress to the next pose only when the current pose is done correctly and held for a specified time.
