## Features:

- Real-time pose detection using camera access on smartphones.
- Machine learning model to assess users' yoga poses.
- Guidance on safe yoga poses for pregnant women.
- Progression to the next pose only when the current pose is done correctly and held for a specified time.

## Libraries:

### Android Jetpack:
- Lifecycle & Livedata
- Kotlin Flow
- Navigation Component
- Kotlin Coroutines

### Android Library:

## Executive Summary/Abstract:

Maternal mortality is a significant global health concern, especially in developing countries. The PregAI: Yoga app addresses this issue by providing pregnant women with a personal yoga instructor equipped with real-time feedback based on machine learning pose estimation tailored to the user's pregnancy trimester. This application aims to provide comfort and safety during prenatal yoga practice.

## How did your team come up with this project?

Prenatal yoga, tailored for expectant mothers, serves the dual purpose of maintaining health during pregnancy and preparing for a safe delivery. To overcome challenges in accessing suitable yoga classes, the team developed a dedicated Kotlin-based application exclusively for pregnant women. This app offers guidance and recognizes yoga movements demonstrated by a yoga instructor.

## Project Scope & Deliverables:

### Project Scope:

- Detect users' poses using smartphone cameras.
- Build a machine learning model to assess users' yoga poses.
- Provide guidance on safe yoga poses for pregnant women.
- Limit detection to simple yoga poses due to time constraints and model size and complexity.

### Deliverables:

- Users can use the application to practice yoga poses correctly and safely.
- Camera-based pose tracking ensures accurate yoga practice.
- Progress to the next pose only when the current pose is done correctly and held for a specified time.
